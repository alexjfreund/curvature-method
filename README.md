# The Curvature Method

This project contains a novel implementation of the Curvature Method for determining the optimal number of clusters in a data set. My implementation is based on a paper published in _Information Sciences_ (2017) [[1]](#1).

## Introduction
Clustering is a major area in Unsupervised Machine Learning. In many clustering algorithms, the number of desired clusters is given as a parameter. Selecting the true cluster number (_k_) can be challenging, as model accuracy increases indefinitely with additional clusters, yet the results become less meaningful. Because the value of _k_ has a dramatic impact on results, it is important to select it carefully. The Curvature Method is a recent approach to this problem, and can be used whenever a desired _k_ value is needed.

The most common method of selecting a true cluster number is known as the "Elbow Method", which involves manually selecting a point along an evaluation graph that appears to contain the sharpest corner. This approach has several problems, as it is empirical and often fails to reveal a clear answer. In contrast, the Curvature Method is quantitative and can be performed quickly to result in an optimal _k_ value, further decoupling the learning process from human intervention.
