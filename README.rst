Introduction
------------

Clustering is a major area in Unsupervised Machine Learning. In many
clustering algorithms, the number of desired clusters is given as a
parameter. Selecting the true cluster number *k* can be challenging, as
model accuracy increases indefinitely with additional clusters, yet
results become less meaningful. Because the value of *k* has a dramatic
impact on results, it is important to select it carefully.

The most common method of selecting a true cluster number is known as
the "Elbow Method", which involves manually selecting a point along an
evaluation graph that appears to contain the sharpest corner. There are
several problems with this approach, as it is empirical and often fails
to reveal a clear solution. In contrast, the Curvature Method is a
recent approach that quantitatively finds an optimal *k* value
`[1] <#1>`__. This approach can be used in a broad range of clustering
applications, further decoupling the learning process from human
intervention.
